# Typing Speed Test Desktop App
This is a desktop application built using Tkinter, a Python GUI toolkit, to measure the typing speed of the user. The app generates a random passage that the user needs to type within a given time limit. After the time is up, the app calculates the number of correct words typed, the accuracy, and the typing speed in words per minute.
